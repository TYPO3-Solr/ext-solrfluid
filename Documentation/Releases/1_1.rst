================================
EXT:solrfluid Releasenotes 1.1.0
================================

This release provides a few bugfixes and new features from the first expierences of solrfluid.


1. New ViewHelper: "Uri/Facet/RemoveFacet"

This ViewHelper can be used to remove all selected items for a whole facet.

```html
    <a href="{s:uri.facet.removeFacet(facet: facet)}">Reset values</a>
```

Thanks to Frans Saris for implementing this.

2. Implement ArrayAccess for "AbstractCollection"

With this you are able to retrieve a facet in the template just by using the name.

```html
    {resultSet.facets.<facetName>}
```

Thanks to Frans Saris for implementing this.

3. Fixed plugin instance name of the Search Form to "pi_search".

Because of a bug in version 1.0.0 you where not able to add a search form as plugin instance.
This is fixed now by using a consistent, same key "pi_search" as in EXT:solr.

Thanks to Thomas Beck for reporting this problem.


4. Moving the query initialization to initializeAction.

We now initialize the query parameter in initializeAction and pass it as argument to have it available in the extbase context.

Thanks to Daniel Siepmann for implementing this.
